We are happy to announce the institution of a new community Dogecoin Core development fund, managed by existing core developers and Dogecoin Foundation board director signatories, along with transparency blog posts forthcoming for all expenditures and developments. The Dogecoin Foundation has taken the step of moving 5,000,000 Dogecoin to the development fund, with the intent that this will be allocated to Dogecoin Core, the development of which is critical and to the benefit of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Fantoumi's questions</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-12-20-fantoumi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-12-20-fantoumi/</guid><description>2022 has been a busy time for the Dogecoin Foundation, there have been solid developments and improvements within the Dogecoin Ecosystem, weâ€™ve had a hugely successful Hackathon thatâ€™s seen many new people introduced to Dogecoin development, and weâ€™ve been able to grow our team through the kind generosity of some big Shibes who are aligned with our mission and want to see us succeed.
That said thereâ€™s been a growing anxiety in the community around a couple of topics which have been taken far out of proportion by a small number of people who seem intent on dividing the community rather than working toward consensus.</description></item><item><title>Oona wants to say a thing</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-12-14-oonabot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-12-14-oonabot/</guid><description>In the spirit of improving communications and transparency Iâ€™d like to take the opportunity to rip the Band-Aid off and let it be known that I have been a volunteer with the Dogecoin Foundation for the past six months. Some of you may remember that in June around my birthday I was invited by members of the Foundation for dinner in Austin. It was an absolutely amazing evening getting to know these people in person.</description></item><item><title>Shibes raise more than 1,000,000 Dogecoin ($100,000) to build a statue of the Doge!</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-12-06-bronzethedoge-success/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-12-06-bronzethedoge-success/</guid><description>In celebration of Kabosu the Doge&amp;rsquo;s 17th birthday, shibes around the world have raised more than 1,000,000 Dogecoin ($100,000) in donations which will be used to create a bronze statue of Kabosu in her home city of Sakura, Japan. Kabosu&amp;rsquo;s owner, Atsuko Sato was kind enough to reach out to Sakura city council, who support the idea of including the statue in their 2024 project to revitalise Furusato Square.
The funds which were raised have been moved into a multisignature wallet and now the work to make the statue of our beloved Doge a reality begins.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Foundation to join the wDoge DAO</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/announcements/2022-09-12-wdoge-bridge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/announcements/2022-09-12-wdoge-bridge/</guid><description>You may have heard talk about bridges in crypto, and recently in relation to Dogecoin.If you search around online for bridges to any major blockchain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum youâ€™ll find plenty of them.
So what are bridges, and how do they affect everyday Shibes using Dogecoin? Much like a physical bridge connects two locations, a crypto bridge connects two blockchains together to allow interaction: usually to allow one coin to be used on the other side of the bridge.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the Inaugural Dogecoin Hackathon</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/announcements/2022-09-08-dogeathon-downunder/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/announcements/2022-09-08-dogeathon-downunder/</guid><description>G&amp;rsquo;day shibes everywhere!

After putting out the call for volunteers on Reddit and Twitter we gathered a group of around 20 Shibes with a wide variety of talents: from writing and translation, to HTML, CSS and graphic design.
Since then the team, beginning with foundation.</description></item><item><title>Shanties, RadioDoge &amp; Financial Freedom</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-04-11-shanty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-04-11-shanty/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the rousing tale of the whalers from Otakou and the Weller Bros trading company that plied its wares amongst them during the 1800s.
What you may not know is that the workers in these stories were often enticed with promises of a good wage, only to find themselves intentionally indebted to trading cooperatives who controlled 100% of the housing, equipment, trade and basic necessities in these remote regions.</description></item><item><title>Ross Nicoll Stepping into an Advisor Role for the Dogecoin Foundation</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/announcements/2022-02-24-update-ross/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/announcements/2022-02-24-update-ross/</guid><description>Recently Ross made public his decision to step back from involvement in the Foundation as a Director and more generally from active development in the crypto space.
While this is news to many in the community, Ross had made his intentions clear to the Core developers almost a year ago and has been working quietly behind the scenes to create a sustainable transition for his role in the Dogecoin project.</description></item><item><title>Let's talk about Development</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/</guid><description>I know that for non-devs (or â€˜not-yet-devs&amp;rsquo; ðŸ˜‰), it can sometimes be difficult to make sense of technical talk. I think that a part of my job as an Engineer at the Dogecoin Foundation is to explain technical things in terms non-tech folk can understand. Because of this, Iâ€™d like to ramble a bit about the Trailmap, about the goals we have and the projects that weâ€™re hoping will fulfil them.</description></item></channel></rss>
