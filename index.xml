We wanted to address this:
Several months ago (noting while an earlier post stated a year, first confirmed mention is April) Binance notified us they had cases where transactions were stuck, meaning they were not being mined successfully. We suggested Binance use RBF (replace by fee) on these transactions, which would replace the original transactions with a new transaction with a higher fee paid.</description></item><item><title>Statement Concerning the 'Dogecoin 2.0' crypto project</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/advisories/2021-08-31-advisory-dogecoin2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/advisories/2021-08-31-advisory-dogecoin2/</guid><description>A number of concerned Shibes from the Dogecoin community have recently brought to our attention the &amp;lsquo;Dogecoin 2.0&amp;rsquo; crypto project, which began earlier this year and has just announced listings on prominent exchanges.
As always, the Dogecoin Foundation welcomes newcomers to the crypto space but this project has no connection to or relationship with Dogecoin. To protect the Dogecoin community from being misled and to protect the Dogecoin name from possible misuse we have asked our brand protection lawyers to contact the developers of the &amp;lsquo;Dogecoin 2.</description></item><item><title>Claims of Affiliation with Dogecoin Foundation</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/advisories/2020-08-18-not-affiliated-moonrabbit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/advisories/2020-08-18-not-affiliated-moonrabbit/</guid><description>Neither the Dogecoin project, the Dogecoin Foundation or any affiliated developers or entities have partnered with MoonRabbit AngoZaibatsu or any affiliated entities, including the purported Dogecoin Foundation using the domain doge.org. This purported organisation and domain are, as far as we have been able to ascertain, run by the same people who run MoonRabbit AngoZaibatsu.
As such, any claim of &amp;ldquo;partnering up&amp;rdquo; appears to be designed to create a false appearance of partnership and association with the long-established Dogecoin project and Dogecoin Foundation.</description></item><item><title>Re-establishing the Dogecoin Foundation</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/announcements/2020-08-15-foundation-announcement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/announcements/2020-08-15-foundation-announcement/</guid><description>It is with great excitement that today we announce the re-establishment of the Dogecoin Foundation (est 2014), with a renewed focus on supporting the Dogecoin Ecosystem, Community and promoting the future of the Dogecoin Blockchain.
Focus The Dogecoin Foundation is not here to ‘take control’ of the Dogecoin Core Wallet project, which remains the primary reference implementation of a compliant Dogecoin Wallet. We are here to accelerate the development effort by supporting current Dogecoin Core and future Dogecoin Developers to work on a full-time basis through sponsorship, as well as providing a welcome landing for new contributors hoping to help with the project.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Foundation Roadmap</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/roadmap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/roadmap/</guid><description>Watch this space, technical &amp;amp; project roadmap for the Foundation is being drafted and will be announced shortly.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/about/</guid><description>About the foundation The Dogecoin Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation established to provide: Support for the Dogecoin crypto-currency through development and advocacy.
